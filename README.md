# Known Issues
For every platform we have tested, we provide an alert map(in ```src/conf/${platform}_alert_map.json```) which provides an unique identifier and text description for SEL events. Alert maps provided may not cover entire possible set, in those cases alerts are sent with identifier 9999.
